# #100DaysofDSAinCSharp

Hi there! My name is Zahere. I am a journalist-turned-Software Engineer striving to be a better coder everyday. In my pursuit to be a better problem-solver, I have set myself a challenge to practice Data Structures and Algorithms everyday for the next 100 days. Following is my plan.
